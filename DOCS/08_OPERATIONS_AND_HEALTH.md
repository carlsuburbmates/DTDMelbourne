# Operations & Health (SSOT Final Aligned)

> OUT OF SCOPE — NON-CANONICAL: Admin panel / AI automation is not part of the current SSOT. Do not implement.

> **SSOT Alignment:** This document is a derived reference. Canonical requirements live in `DOCS/SSOT/SSOT_FINAL.md`.

## Reference Notes (Non-Canonical)
- Admin side targets minimal manual oversight
- Emergency flows are isolated from monetisation
- Suburb-first geography with council/region auto-derived

---

## Non-Functional Expectations (From SSOT)
- Fast search and triage (<1s)
- Emergency prioritisation
- Data correctness via authoritative suburb-council mapping
- Scalable to 5,000+ listings
- Immutable SSOT assets with CI enforcement

---

## DECISION REQUIRED (Not in SSOT)
- Operator workflows, alerting thresholds, and incident playbooks
- Monitoring stack and health dashboards
- Manual intervention procedures
